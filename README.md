Problem Statement:

A person’s creditworthiness is often associated (conversely) with the likelihood they may default on loans. 

We’re giving you anonymized data on about 1000 loan applications, along with a certain set of attributes about the applicant itself, and whether they were considered high risk.

0 = Low credit risk i.e high chance of paying back the loan amount

1 = High credit risk i.e low chance of paying back the loan amount

INTRODUCTION
There are two datasets which consists of data related with applicant and loan. We have anonymized data on about 1000 loan applications, along with a certain set of attributes about the applicant itself, and whether they were considered high risk.
1.	Applicant: This dataset consists of data related to applicant. Having nearly about 15 features

2.	Loan: This dataset consists of  information related to customer’s loan and consists of nearly 13 features.
 The primary focus of this project is in depth analysis of the factors associated with credit risk . The different algorithms used are: Linear Regression, Random Forest and Decision Trees.
 
 METHODOLOGY
We analyzed several data mining techniques to handle missing data, remove redundancy and resolve data conflicts. The Data Mining techniques are used to handle missing data. After analyzing we found that there were so many missing data. So, In order to get rid of redundant data, we perform correlation analysis with the help of plots to check if the attributes are positively or negatively correlated if not redundant. To train the model we used Random Forest Regressor. 

CONCLUSION:
1. On the basis of employment Status it be concluded that skilled employees are less risky than any other category.
2. Customer who belong to the category existing loan paid back are less risky, they are expected to pay back loan to the company. Their history is also good as well.
3. The customer who has high loan amount and having own property and low saving account with high balance account are expected to back (low risky).
